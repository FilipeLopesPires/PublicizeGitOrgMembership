# Publicize Git Org Membership
Tool to publicize GitHub organization membership for large organizations

## Description

GitHub provides [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership) on how to publicize or hide a user's membership to a given organization.
However, the tools provided can fail to locate the user for organizations with a large number of members (100k+).

This Node project provides a simple way to overcome this limitation and modify membership visibility to public on large GitHub organizations.
